# Simple 2D Java Game

***

## Introduction

This game is a work in progress, using Java, LibGDX, and gradle. As of right now, 03/19, the game 
is only being developed for desktop environments. This github repo for anyone who is interested in game
development or wants to get started making games with Java. I decided on Java for this game because it's super easy to pick up, but very powerful if you can use it right. LibGDX is the same way, albeit with a little steeper learning curve.

## Build

The source code for all of the classes are in [src/com/mygdx/game](https://github.com/Farmerjoe12/Simple2DJavaGame/tree/master/2DGame/core/src/com/mygdx/game)
and all of the images and textures are in the assets folder.

The project is under development using the latest version of eclipse and gradle, so you'll need the same to configure your IDE.

The master repository is being built in Eclipse so that's what the HOWTOBUILD file assumes of you. 

If you prefer a different IDE, then by all means, configure this project to work in that IDE and then add your steps to the HOWTOBUILD file. 

**We are not trying to constrain you to our way of development in any way. You can contribute in any way you feel comfortable. This game is being developed for beginners and by beginners, and we're all learning here.**

## Notes/Remarks

Github is still partially a foreign language to me, but I'm learning more and more every day. 

Even if you think you don't know git, there's hundreds of videos and thousands more blog posts and questions on StackExchange where someone had the same exact question as you. You're not alone in the quest to understand the intricasies of version control, so don't hesitate to make yourself known on this repository or on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5gXN8yW).

Thanks for checking us out!
