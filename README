This game is a work in progress, using Java, LibGDX, and gradle. As of right now, 03/19, the game 
is only being developed for desktop environments. I am creating a github repo for anyone who is interested in game
development or wants to get started in the field with Java as their language of choice. I am a Software Engineering student
with a passion for video games, so naturally I'm going to take the language I know the best and start developing. 

I'm not super familiar with gitHub as of yet, so this project will also help me learn version control systems and the
gitHub service from the inside out. If you're new like me and you're interested in contributing, feel free to make a fork and create some issues! 

The source code for all of the classes are in src/com/mygdx/game and all of the images and textures are in the assets folder.

I am using the latest version of eclipse and gradle, so you'll need the same to work on this project.
